Now I want to send this txt to my laptop 20-05-2017 23:29

Vanuit Git met slechts 1 commando overgehaald: 
$ git clone https://github.com/Sander54/justtesting.git
That worked fine!!!  23:48

Mm it seems I wont be difficult to change teh file and send it back...

But if so, what remains of this text....?
